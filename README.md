# Candy Machine UI

This Solana program is a simple program that mints NFTs through a candy machine concept UI. There is a limited amount in stock. A base fee must be paid in a spl token to get a random selected NFT with in the candy machine. It's purpose is to get familiar with the token and NFT process with transactions.

## Note

Currently this project is a work in progress. the minting process fails through the UI. Minting can still be down through the sugar cli.
